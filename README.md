# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to complete the entire process of data importation to data cleaning. The goal was to use the knowledge that I have acuquired in lecture to achieve this.

## Process
### The first step was importing the csv file by initially creating a table with identical columns in PostgreSQL.
### My second step was to use data cleaning principles to remove the duplicates and ensure that there is quality data to analyze.
### My next step was to explore the data using the functions taught to create tables that answer our business questions
### The final part of the process was to develop a quality assurance 

## Results
I did not properly clean the data as I missed some duplications within the dataset, therefore we can assume that all the data results were skewed or wrong.

## Challenges 
I faced many challenges throughout the completion of this project. The two main challenges I faced were the importation process and the data cleaning process since the data was really difficult to understand.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would take a longer time cleaning the data to ensure that my data analysis is more accurate. I would also develop a QA process before I start my data exploration, so I can ensure that the results are accurate.
